ThoughtSpot provides three ways to authenticate users  LDAP/AD, SAML, and
ThoughtSpot login. In general, ThoughtSpot recommends that you use LDAP/AD or
SAML if possible since ThoughtSpot provides only basic authentication with no
restrictions on passwords, timeouts, failed logins, etc.


The table below shows each of the options and the items to consider for each.

    <li>Can redirect from ThoughtSpot to SAML logins.</li>

    <li>User created and managed in ThoughtSpot.</li>
    <li>No enterprise password control (expiration, password strength, etc.).</li>

All users and groups must be known to ThoughtSpot. If you are using LDAP/AD or
SAML and donâ€™t create users in ThoughtSpot, a user is created when the user
first logs in. However, this user is assigned to the `All` group and will only
see content available for all users.

Groups are the primary way that security is managed. Groups are not
automatically created. You can create groups and users manually or you need to
automate the assignment from a source system. ThoughtSpot has an assignment
script that works with most LDAP / AD stores. It also has public APIs that you
can use to sync users and groups between source systems and your ThoughtSpot
appliance.
